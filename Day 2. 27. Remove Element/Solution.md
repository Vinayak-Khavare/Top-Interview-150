Certainly! Let’s break down the `removeElement` function step-by-step to understand its purpose and functionality.

### Function Overview

The `removeElement` function is designed to remove all occurrences of a specified value (`val`) from a vector (`nums`) and then return the new length of the vector after the removal. The removal is done in-place, meaning the function does not use extra space for another vector.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Signature:**

   ```cpp
   int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val)
   ```

   - **`int`**: The function returns an integer which is the new length of the vector after removing the specified value.
   - **`vector<int>& nums`**: A reference to a vector of integers where the removal will take place. The vector is modified in place.
   - **`int val`**: The value that needs to be removed from the vector.

2. **Initialize Variables:**

   ```cpp
   int k = 0;
   int n = nums.size();
   ```

   - **`int k = 0;`**: `k` is used as an index to keep track of the position where the next non-`val` element should be placed in the vector.
   - **`int n = nums.size();`**: `n` stores the initial size of the vector. This is used for the loop iteration.

3. **Iterate Over the Vector:**

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
   ```

   - The loop iterates over each element in the vector, with `i` being the current index.

4. **Check and Move Elements:**

   ```cpp
   if (nums[i] != val) {
       nums[k] = nums[i];
       k++;
   }
   ```

   - **`if (nums[i] != val)`**: This condition checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is not equal to the value `val`.
   - **`nums[k] = nums[i];`**: If the current element is not `val`, it is moved to the position `k` in the vector.
   - **`k++;`**: After moving the element, increment `k` to point to the next position where a non-`val` element should be placed.

5. **Return the New Length:**

   ```cpp
   return k;
   ```

   - After the loop finishes, `k` contains the number of elements that are not equal to `val`. This represents the new length of the vector with `val` removed.

### Example

Let’s go through an example to see how the function works:

Suppose we have the following vector and value to remove:

- **`nums`**: `[3, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
- **`val`**: `3`

1. **Initial State**:
   - `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
   - `k = 0`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **`i = 0`**: `nums[0]` is `3` (equal to `val`), so skip.
   - **`i = 1`**: `nums[1]` is `2` (not equal to `val`), set `nums[0] = 2`, increment `k` to `1`.
   - **`i = 2`**: `nums[2]` is `2` (not equal to `val`), set `nums[1] = 2`, increment `k` to `2`.
   - **`i = 3`**: `nums[3]` is `3` (equal to `val`), so skip.
   - **`i = 4`**: `nums[4]` is `4` (not equal to `val`), set `nums[2] = 4`, increment `k` to `3`.

3. **Final State**:
   - `nums = [2, 2, 4, 3, 4]` (only the first `k` elements are valid).
   - `k = 3`

The function will return `3`, indicating that the length of the modified vector is `3` and the first `3` elements are `[2, 2, 4]` with `3` removed.

### Summary

The `removeElement` function effectively removes all occurrences of a specified value from a vector in-place and returns the new length of the vector. The elements that are not removed are compacted at the beginning of the vector. The function does this with a single pass through the vector and in constant extra space.
