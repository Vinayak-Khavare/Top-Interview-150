The provided class `Solution` contains a method `majorityElement` that finds the majority element in a given vector of integers using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

### Class and Method Definition

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
```

- The `Solution` class encapsulates the `majorityElement` method.
- The method takes a reference to a vector of integers `nums` and returns an integer.

### Initial Setup

```cpp
int candidate = nums[0];
int count = 1;
```

- Initialize the first element of the vector as the candidate majority element.
- Initialize the counter `count` to 1.

### Phase 1: Finding the Candidate

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    if(nums[i] == candidate) {
        count++;
    } else {
        count--;
        if(count == 0) {
            candidate = nums[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

- Iterate through the vector starting from the second element.
- If the current element `nums[i]` is the same as the candidate, increment the counter `count`.
- If the current element is different from the candidate, decrement the counter.
- If the counter drops to zero, update the candidate to the current element and reset the counter to 1.

### Phase 2: Verifying the Candidate (Optional)

```cpp
count = 0;
for(int num : nums) {
    if(num == candidate) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

- Reset the counter `count` to 0.
- Iterate through the vector and count the occurrences of the candidate.

### Returning the Result

```cpp
if(count > nums.size() / 2) {
    return candidate;
} else {
    return -1; // This case should not happen as per the problem statement
}
```

- If the count of the candidate is more than half the size of the vector, return the candidate.
- Otherwise, return `-1`. This is a safeguard and should not happen according to the problem statement which guarantees that a majority element always exists.

### Summary

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm works in two phases:

1. **Candidate Selection:** It finds a candidate for the majority element in linear time.
2. **Candidate Verification:** It verifies if the candidate is indeed the majority element by counting its occurrences.

This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\).
