Certainly! The given code is a C++ function to remove duplicates from a sorted array in place. Let's break it down step by step.

### Objective

The goal is to remove duplicates from a sorted array `nums` and return the length of the array with unique elements only. The array should be modified in place, meaning no extra space should be used beyond the original array.

### Function Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l=1;

        for(int r=1; r<nums.size(); r++){
            if(nums[r]!=nums[r-1]){
                nums[l]=nums[r];
                l++;
            }
        }

        return l;
    }
};
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **Function Signature**:
   ```cpp
   int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums)
   ```
   - This function takes a reference to a vector of integers (`vector<int>& nums`) and returns an integer. The vector is modified in place.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int l = 1;
   ```
   - `l` is initialized to 1. It represents the index in the array where the next unique element should be placed.

3. **Iterating through the Array**:
   ```cpp
   for(int r = 1; r < nums.size(); r++) {
   ```
   - `r` is the index used to scan through the array starting from the second element (`r = 1`), since the first element is always unique by itself.

4. **Check for Unique Element**:
   ```cpp
   if(nums[r] != nums[r - 1]) {
   ```
   - This condition checks if the current element (`nums[r]`) is different from the previous element (`nums[r - 1]`). If true, it means `nums[r]` is unique.

5. **Place Unique Element**:
   ```cpp
   nums[l] = nums[r];
   l++;
   ```
   - When a unique element is found, it is placed at the `l`-th index, and then `l` is incremented to point to the next position for future unique elements.

6. **Return the Length of Unique Elements**:
   ```cpp
   return l;
   ```
   - After the loop, `l` will be the count of unique elements in the array. This is returned as the length of the array with duplicates removed.

### Summary

- **Input**: A sorted vector `nums` with possible duplicate elements.
- **Output**: The length of the array with duplicates removed, where the first part of the array up to this length contains the unique elements.

### Example

Consider `nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`:

- Initial state: `nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`, `l = 1`.
- Iteration steps:
  - `r = 1`: `nums[1] == nums[0]` (duplicate, no action).
  - `r = 2`: `nums[2] != nums[1]` (unique), update `nums[1]` to `2`, increment `l` to `2`.
  - `r = 3`: `nums[3] != nums[2]` (unique), update `nums[2]` to `3`, increment `l` to `3`.
  - `r = 4`: `nums[4] == nums[3]` (duplicate, no action).
  - `r = 5`: `nums[5] != nums[4]` (unique), update `nums[3]` to `4`, increment `l` to `4`.

- Final state: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]` (first 4 elements are unique), `l = 4`.

The function returns `4`, which is the count of unique elements.

This approach ensures that duplicates are removed efficiently with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\), making it ideal for problems involving sorted arrays and in-place modifications.
